# ðŸ§  Algorithm Practice

Welcome to my personal algorithm practice repository!  
This repo contains a variety of algorithmic problems I've solved to sharpen my problem-solving and JavaScript skills. Problems are categorized by difficulty: **easy**, **medium**, and **hard**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Improve problem-solving and logical thinking
- Practice writing clean and efficient code
- Prepare for coding interviews and technical assessments
- Build consistency through daily or weekly challenge solving
